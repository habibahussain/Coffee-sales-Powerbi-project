Excited to share my latest Power Bl project: Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis and Visualization! ☕📊

This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data from a coffee shop, providing actionable insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency
to drive business growth and improve customer satisfaction.
Here are some key insights:

📈 Sales Trends: Sales increased from January to June, with June recording the highest sales of $166k.

📆 Weekly Patterns: Weekdays consistently record much higher July17 sales than weekends across all months.

📍Location Analysis: Sales are consistent across all three store locations, with minimal variation.

☕ Product Popularity: Coffee is the most sold product among all categories.

⏰Hourly Sales: The highest sales occur between 7 AM and 10 AM, gradually decreasing throughout the rest of the day.

I'm thrilled to leverage Power Bl to uncover these insights and help the coffee shop enhance its business strategies! 🚀✨
